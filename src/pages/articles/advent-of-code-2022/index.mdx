I am participating in the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/" target="_blank">Advent of Code</a> this year. I will be posting my solutions here.

<a class={linkClasses} href="/articles/advent-of-code-2022/advent-of-code-2022-day-1">Day 1 - Solving the first day of the Advent of Code 2022 with PHP</a>
<a class={linkClasses} href="/articles/advent-of-code-2022/advent-of-code-2022-day-2">Day 2 - So we are cheating at Rock, Paper, Scissors. These elves are shady.</a>
<a class={linkClasses} href="/articles/advent-of-code-2022/advent-of-code-2022-day-3">Day 3 - Bags of holding? These elves are crazy. I wonder what they are up to.</a>
<a class={linkClasses} href="/articles/advent-of-code-2022/advent-of-code-2022-day-4">Day 4 - If we have to clean, we might as well do it efficiently. Let’s write a script to clean up the data.</a>
<a class={linkClasses} href="/articles/advent-of-code-2022/advent-of-code-2022-day-5">Day 5 - Programming the CrateMover9000, oh wait, it’s the CraneMover9001!</a>
<a class={linkClasses} href="/articles/advent-of-code-2022/advent-of-code-2022-day-6">Day 6 - Decoding secret messages because we are super experienced in it.</a>
<a class={linkClasses} href="/articles/advent-of-code-2022/advent-of-code-2022-day-7">Day 7 - Converting console output to a tree structure and searching for directory sizing.</a>
<a class={linkClasses} href="/articles/advent-of-code-2022/advent-of-code-2022-day-8">Day 8 - No time for an article today, so you get a code snippet instead.</a>

Here I stopped doing the Advent of Code. I was too busy with other things. I might pick it up again next year. Maybe I will do the 2022 edition in 2023. Who knows.
