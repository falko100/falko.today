## Introduction
The world of app development is changing rapidly. No-code platforms are emerging everywhere, tempting with their promises of speed, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness. But are they truly the solution for everyone? In this article, we'll dive deeper into the world of no-code and explain why we, despite the allure of no-code, choose custom app development with Laravel. Are you ready to broaden your horizons? Let's begin!

## What is no-code?
No-code platforms are tools that allow users without programming knowledge to develop and manage applications. Using ready-made components and templates, anyone, even without a technical background, can put together a working app. It sounds almost too good to be true, right? Although no-code platforms have their advantages, there are also limitations and pitfalls to consider.

## The benefits of no-code
1. Speed: No-code platforms enable you to build a working app quickly. The components and templates are already created for you, so you don't have to start from scratch. This means you can focus on the design and functionality of the app instead of the technical details.
2. Accessibility: No-code platforms are designed to be accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical background. This means you don't need programming knowledge to build an app. It's a matter of dragging and dropping, clicking, and adjusting.
3. Cost-effectiveness: No-code platforms are a cost-effective solution for building apps. Most platforms offer a free trial period, allowing you to build and test the app for free. If you're satisfied with the result, you can sign up for a paid subscription.
4. User-friendliness: No-code platforms are designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. Most platforms provide a visual interface that lets you build the app by dragging and dropping components. This means you don't need programming knowledge to build an app.
5. Support: No-code platforms offer extensive support for their users. Most platforms provide a comprehensive knowledge base, tutorials, and a community forum where users can ask questions and find answers.

## Why choose Laravel?
1. Customization: Laravel gives us the ability to create tailor-made solutions that perfectly align with the unique needs of our clients. This goes far beyond the pre-built components and templates of no-code platforms. After all, who doesn't want an application that fits like a custom suit?
2. Scalability: Laravel ensures that our applications can effortlessly handle a growing number of users, data, and complex processes. This enables our clients to grow their businesses without worrying about technical limitations. A solid foundation for future growth is invaluable, isn't it?
3. Control and maintainability: By using Laravel, we have full control over the codebase, ensuring top quality, efficiency, and maintainability. A smooth machine that helps us solve problems, detect errors, and optimize.
4. Security and compliance: Laravel is our reliable companion, helping us provide robust security features and compliance, even for industries with strict regulations and data protection requirements. A reassuring thought, right?
5. Version control: No-code platforms fall short when it comes to version control, tracking, and backup of functionality. Thanks to git, we can meticulously track and manage each new feature with Laravel. Collaboration, change tracking, and iterative development become a breeze, resulting in a smooth and efficient development process.

Although we have used multiple no-code platforms for some clients, providing them with a simple and fast headless CMS, we still find ourselves preferring Laravel for a variety of projects due to its numerous advantages as outlined above. Laravel not only offers a robust and versatile framework, but it also allows us to deliver tailored solutions that align with our clients' unique requirements and objectives, ensuring their applications remain agile and adaptable for future growth.

## Conclusion
No-code platforms certainly have their place in the world of app development, especially for simple projects and for those without a technical background. However, when it comes to customization, scalability, control, security and compliance, and version control, Laravel is an excellent choice for developers and businesses striving for quality and growth.
Moreover, Laravel offers a fantastic Developer Experience (DX), thanks to its well-thought-out architecture, extensive documentation, and active community. This allows us to
