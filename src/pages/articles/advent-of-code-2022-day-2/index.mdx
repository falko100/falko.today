## Introduction

Iâ€™m not yet sure if I should write a blog post for every day of the Advent of Code or combine them into one post.
For now, Iâ€™ll try to write a post for every day and see how that goes.

## Spoilers ahead of the challenges of Day 2

If you plan on doing the challenges, I would advise you to not read any further. The solutions are posted below, and I will explain how I solved them.
After doing the challenges, you can come back and read this article to see how I solved them.

## The assignment (part 1)

> "Elves are competative, so letâ€™s give them a game to play. The Elves play a game called Rock, Paper, Scissors. Itâ€™s played by two players, where each player chooses one of three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The rules are as follows:"
> "Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock. If both players choose the same option, itâ€™s a tie. The first player to win 2 out of 3 rounds wins the game."
> <br /> â€” Artificial Intelligence Santa

We got an input file containing a list of combinations. An elf explains to us that the first character of each line is the opponentâ€™s choice, and the second character is ... the elf is called away.
We need to figure out what the second character is. We assume that the second character repesents our choice.

```
A Y
B X
C Z
```

For winning, we get 6 points, for losing 0 points, and for a tie 3 points.
The choice of hand also adds a bonus to the score. 1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors.
We need to calculate the total score of the input file.

## Formatting the input

We need to read the input file and format it into an array of objects.
Each object should contain the opponentâ€™s choice and our choice.

```php
// Getting the input from the file
$input = collect(explode("\n", Storage::get('input-2.txt')))
  // Splitting the combinations into an array
  ->map(fn($line) => explode(' ', $line))
  // Removing the empty line at the end
  ->filter(fn($line) => count($line) === 2)
  // Converting the characters to readable values
  ->map(function ($line) {
      $line[0] = str_replace(['A', 'B', 'C'], ['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors'], $line[0]);
      $line[1] = str_replace(['X', 'Y', 'Z'], ['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors'], $line[1]);

      return $line;
  });
```

## Calculating the score

We need to calculate the score for each combination.
We can do this by mapping each combination into a score.
Letâ€™s not forget the bonus score, because this will lead to a wrong answer.
Not saying Iâ€™ve seen the "This is not the correct answer" screen... ğŸ˜…

Ok... letâ€™s get back to the code.

```php
$results = $input->map(function ($line) {
  $elf = $line[0];
  $me = $line[1];

  // The bonus for the choice of hand
  $bonus = match ($me) {
    'Rock' => 1,
    'Paper' => 2,
    'Scissors' => 3,
  };

  // Check if we win or lose, base the score on this
  return match ($elf) {
    'Rock' => match ($me) {
      'Rock' => 3 + $base,
      'Paper' => 6 + $base,
      'Scissors' => 0 + $base,
    },
    'Paper' => match ($me) {
      'Rock' => 0 + $base,
      'Paper' => 3 + $base,
      'Scissors' => 6 + $base,
    },
    'Scissors' => match ($me) {
      'Rock' => 6 + $base,
      'Paper' => 0 + $base,
      'Scissors' => 3 + $base,
    },
  };
```

And now we can easy get the total score:

```php
echo 'The anser to challenge 1 is: ' . $results->sum();
```

## Part 2 - The actual strategy

The shady elf returns. He explains that the second character is not our choice, but whether we should win or lose.
Now our code needs to be adjusted to take this into account. Thereâ€™s an easy way to do it. Letâ€™s start by adjusting the mapping:

```php
$line[1] = str_replace(['X', 'Y', 'Z'], ['Lose', 'Draw', 'Win'], $line[1]);
```

We just need to determine the value of `$me` based on the `$line[1]` value.

```php
$me = match ($result) {
  'Lose' => match ($elf) {
    'Rock' => 'Scissors',
    'Paper' => 'Rock',
    'Scissors' => 'Paper',
  },
  'Draw' => match ($elf) {
    'Rock' => 'Rock',
    'Paper' => 'Paper',
    'Scissors' => 'Scissors',
  },
  'Win' => match ($elf) {
    'Rock' => 'Paper',
    'Paper' => 'Scissors',
    'Scissors' => 'Rock',
  },
};
```

And thatâ€™s it. We now have the correct answer for the second challenge.

```php
echo 'The anser to challenge 2 is: ' . $results->sum();
```
