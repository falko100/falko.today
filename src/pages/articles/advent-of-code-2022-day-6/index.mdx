## Introduction

Day 6, new day, new puzzle. Despite solving it within the first half hour since release, I did not make the leaderboards.

## Spoilers ahead of the challenges of Day 5

If you plan on doing the challenges, I would advise you to not read any further. The solutions are posted below, and I will explain how I solved them.
After doing the challenges, you can come back and read this article to see how I solved them.

## The assignment

The elves need me for my excellent decoding skills. Or as they say "significant experience dealing with signal-based systems".

> "Secret transmissions are being sent to Santa's weather station, but the data is encrypted with a strange new algorithm. The data is being sent as a stream of bits (your puzzle input), but because the signal is quite weak, there are many more 0 bits than 1 bits. The data being sent to you is what appears to be random data, but for each character, the only possible characters are either `0` or `1`, based on the most common bit in the data so far. Even after signal-jamming noise, you can look at the letter distributions in each column and choose the least common letter to reconstruct the original message."

Our sample data is as follows:

```txt
mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb
```

For the first part of this puzzle, we need to find the first character where the previous 3 characters aren't duplicates. In this case, it's `m`.
With an index of 7.

## Let’s solve this puzzle!

```php
$input = 'mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb';

// We start at the 4th character, because we need to check the previous 3 characters.
for ($i = 3; $i < strlen($input); $i++) {
  // The make a substring of the current character and the previous 3 characters.
  $set = substr($input, $i - 3, 4);

  // If the set is not unique, we continue to the next character.
  if (strlen($set) === count(array_unique(str_split($set)))) {
    dd('The resulting character is: ' . $i + 1);
  }
}
```

That one was quite easy. The second part of the puzzle is just as simple.
Instead of groups of 4, the groups are 14 characters.

```php
$input = 'mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb';

// We start at the 14th character, because we need to check the previous 13 characters.
for ($i = 13; $i < strlen($input); $i++) {
  // The make a substring of the current character and the previous 3 characters.
  $set = substr($input, $i - 13, 14);

  // If the set is not unique, we continue to the next character.
  if (strlen($set) === count(array_unique(str_split($set)))) {
    dd('The resulting character is: ' . $i + 1);
  }
}
```
